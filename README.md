# whac-a-alien
This game was inspired by the Whac-A-Mole game. This game involves moving a hammer with keybaord keys and pressing space to attack an alien. Your score is dependent on the number of aliens you hit before the time runs out. This game was built from scratch, and applies concepts such as keyboard interrupts, timer interrupts, graphics animation and double buffering. This was done as a project for ECE243 - Computer Organization. All the pixels you see on the left were drawn "manually", or an image was converted to pixels to be drawn.
